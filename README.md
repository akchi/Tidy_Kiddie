## Tidy Kiddie

A web application designed to assist the parent/teachers of young children to understand the preventive measures of the prominent infections.

This project includes 3 main functions:
<ol>
  <li>Learn : The parent/teachers can learn if their region is in a high or a low risk zone, preventive measures (infographic) for the prominent infections affecting young children.</li>
  <li>Train: An interactive game where the children gain knowledge about preventive measures they can take in their daily lives.</li>
  <li>Protect: A list of vaccines the child must have recieved prior to the given age group.</li>
</ol>

Although, this repository contains the code related to <b>learn</b> and <b>protect</b> alone.
