## Tidy Kiddie

Tidy Kiddie is a project that addresses an authentic and relevant social issue : **Prevention of infections in a work place.**

An educational website designed to assist the parent/teachers of young children to understand the preventive measures of prominent infections in regional Victoria:
- Barown Sowth West
- Gippsland
- Grampians
- Hume
- Loddon Mallee

This project includes 3 main functions:
<ol>
  <li>Learn : The parent/teachers can learn if their region is in a high or a low risk zone, preventive measures (infographic) for the prominent infections affecting young children.</li>
  <li>Train: An interactive game where the children gain knowledge about preventive measures they can take in their daily lives.</li>
  <li>Protect: A list of vaccines the child must have recieved prior to the given age group.</li>
</ol>

As I was involved in the development of the *Learn* and *Protect* functionas, this repository contains the code related to theses parts only.
